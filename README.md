# react-mini

# Why
I built this project because I write the widgets library for traitify, and a couple co workers discussed using react.js for our  widget views.
The problem with using react.js was it was too large to bundle with our api client, so I went into react.js and tried to get a handle on some of the things they were doing and recreate tthem.
